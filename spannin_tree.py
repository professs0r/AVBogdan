    A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of the graph (a tree)

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected Graph
       An undirected graph. If `G` is connected, then the algorithm finds a

    algorithm : string
       The algorithm to use when finding a minimum spanning tree. Valid

    weight : string
       Edge data key to use for weight (default 'weight').

    keys : bool
       Whether to yield edge key in multigraphs in addition to the edge.
       If `G` is not a multigraph, this is ignored.

    data : bool, optional

    Returns
    -------
    edges : iterator
       An iterator over edges in a maximum spanning tree of `G`.
       Edges connecting nodes `u` and `v` are represented as tuples:
       `(u, v, k, d)` or `(u, v, k)` or `(u, v, d)` or `(u, v)`

       If `G` is a multigraph, `keys` indicates whether the edge key `k` will
       be reported in the third position in the edge tuple. `data` indicates
       whether the edge datadict `d` will appear at the end of the edge tuple.

       If `G` is not a multigraph, the tuples are `(u, v, d)` if `data` is True
       or `(u, v)` if `data` is False.

    Find minimum spanning edges by Kruskal's algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)

    """
    Sample a random spanning tree using the edges weights of `G`.

    This function supports two different methods for determining the
    probability of the graph. If ``multiplicative=True``, the probability
    is based on the product of edge weights, and if ``multiplicative=False``
    it is based on the sum of the edge weight. However, since it is
    easier to determine the total weight of all spanning trees for the
    multiplicative verison, that is significantly faster and should be used if
    possible. Additionally, setting `weight` to `None` will cause a spanning tree
    to be selected with uniform probability.

    The function uses algorithm A8 in [1]_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        An undirected version of the original graph.

    weight : string
        The edge key for the edge attribute holding edge weight.

    multiplicative : bool, default=True
        If `True`, the probability of each tree is the product of its edge weight
        over the sum of the product of all the spanning trees in the graph. If
        `False`, the probability is the sum of its edge weight over the sum of
        the sum of weights for all spanning trees in the graph.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
